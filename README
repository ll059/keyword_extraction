In the project, the key phrases related to ICD10 definition are extracted from the patientâ€™s medical documents in three steps, (1) vectorize documents to get candidate keywords, (2) use a LLM sentence transformer to embed candidate keywords and ICD10 description, (3) compute the cosine similarity between the two embedding vectors. The newly discovered key phrases are added to CUI (Concept Unique Identifier) library.
